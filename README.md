Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment

In conclusion, of my software security course this portfolio of Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report, is meant to demonstrate my journey in vulnerability assessment and secure coding. Artemis Financial is an investment management firm that I've had the opportunity to work with, aiming at the identification and addressing of security vulnerabilities in their software applications. I learned from critical problems, such as SQL injection and insecure APIs, how important the security of coding was for me to protect financial information and not lose users' trust. Priority was a challenge in ranking them in accordance with their severity of exploitation, a process which continued to deepen my understanding of risk management. Overall I implemented different security improvements such as input validation and encryption. Lastly, I employed OWASP ZAP in ensuring that the application is safe, aside from being functional, upon my modifications.
