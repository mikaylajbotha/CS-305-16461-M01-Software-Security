# Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment

In conclusion of my software security course, this portfolio item consisting of a vulnerability assessment report for Artemis Financial is meant to demonstrate my journey in vulnerability assessment and secure coding. Artemis Financial is an investment management firm that I've had the opportunity to work with, aiming at the identification and remediation of security vulnerabilities in their software applications. I learned from critical problems, such as SQL injection and insecure APIs, how important the security of coding is for me to protect financial information and not lose users' trust. Triaging was a challenge in ranking vulnerabilities according to their severity of exploitation, a process which continued to deepen my understanding of risk management. Overall, I implemented different security improvements such as input validation and encryption. Lastly, I employed OWASP ZAP in ensuring that the application remained safe, aside from being functional, upon my modifications.
